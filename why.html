							<p>Wondering what Snapchat is? Well it's an app where you can take photos and use filters to create good memories. The first photo shows the basic layout of Snapchat. The 2nd photo shows the filters you have access to as a user. These types of filters animate things on to your face. You can have dog ears, hearts floating above your head or glasses with a cool background!</p>
